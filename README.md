# CM Launcher

A rewrite of the DreamMaker backed CMLauncher, using [Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/) and managing BYOND versions internally.

## Features

### BYOND
- Automatically installs the correct version for the game server you are connecting to.
- Private WebView2 install location to avoid conflicts with system BYOND.

### Authentication
- CM-SS13 Authentication via web browser authentication flow
  - Handles tokens refresh to stay logged in indefinitely
- BYOND Authentication via pager
- Steam Authentication via Authentication ticket flow/Authentik backend

### Rich Presence
- Supports Steam and Discord rich presence
- Displays currently launched server, as well as the number of players online
- Allows friends to join directly from the friends list

### CI/CD
- Automatically deploys tagged versions to GitHub Releases and Steam
- Steam releases are pushed to a `latest` branch for manual deployment to `default`.

## Development

Run the project with:
```bash
# both backend and frontend dev (with hotreloading)
npm run tauri -- dev (-f steam) # to build with steam

# production build (cargo will recompile in release)
npm run tauri build
```

In order to run the Steam build in development, you will need to place a file named `steam_appid.txt` in src-tauri/ containing `4313790`. Otherwise, the app will immediately close and attempt to reopen via Steam.

### Releasing

Use `tools/release.sh [semver]` to change the version in `Cargo.toml`, create a commit changing the version, and tag that commit with the semver. When this is pushed, GitHub Actions will push new builds to both GitHub Releases and Steam.

Manually download the `.msi` and `.exe` and upload these to [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/filesubmission) to /try/ and avoid SmartScreen when installed via GitHub Releases.
